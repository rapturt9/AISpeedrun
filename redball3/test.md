So, to test, download the flash player and the swf file which contains the game. You should then be able to run the redball TAS by double clicking. The controls are:

**x: start the AI speedrun testing. For it work, you need to be also running the python server file**

g: hold to play the game at a normal rate

h: advance 1 frame

b: toggle normal game rate. Like "g" but toggle

y: rewind one frame. This can't take you to the first frame of a level or to any previous levels.

t: rewind to the frame in the frame counter(you can edit it). This can only take you backwards in time, and can't take you to the first frame of a level or to any previous levels.

e: restart from the beginning of the level as if you had just entered it(with the same velocity as when you entered it and with no checkpoints)

j: load the inputs you have, so that you can use "g", "h" and "b" to run at your own pace

u: load the inputs you have and play them instantly

i: load the inputs you have and play them in real time

k: press to set the position/speed to the values in all the individual text boxes(you can edit them)

l: set the position/speed to the values in the last text box

o: output the inputs you have execute for all levels you have completed and the level you are in to the input text box. A way of exporting your run.

1-9: save you the inputs you have executed in your current level to the corresponding save state 1-9

shift + 1-9: load the inputs you have saved in the corresponding save state 1-9 into the input text box and restart the level so that you can play the inputs using "j", "i", or "u"

ctrl + 1-9: instantly playback the inputs you have saved in the corresponding save state 1-9

q: toggle the textboxes(except for the frame counter) on and off
